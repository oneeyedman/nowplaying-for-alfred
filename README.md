# NowPlaying for Alfred

![GitHub tag (latest SemVer pre-release)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/oneeyedman/nowplaying-for-alfred?labelColor=%23414141&color=%23ffcc00)

This AppleScript workflow detects if a song is being played on Apple Music or Spotify, then extracts the names of both the artist and the song, composes a string using a template and copies it to your clipboard.

## Template

This is the template used to compose the final string. ~~The URL will only appear if the song is played on Spotify~~.

```text
‚ô¨ <SONG_NAME> - <ARTIST_NAME>  ‚Üí <URL> 

#Spotify|AppleMusic #NowPlaying
```

### Samples

```text
‚ô¨ Future World - Helloween ‚Üí https://music.apple.com/es/album/future-world/1144728708?i=1144728856&uo=4

#AppleMusic #NowPlaying 
 ```

 ```text
 ‚ô¨ Royals - Lorde ‚Üí http://open.spotify.com/track/4zztp85oS36ijgAWwyhX8p 
 
 #Spotify #NowPlaying
 ```

To obtain the Apple Music URL, I haven't found any other way than using an Apple shortcut that achieves the magic and copies the link to the clipboard. **You can download it from [this iCloud link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/651f3e461698422da240c7d1c217688b)**.

![Steps of the shortcut to obtain the URL of the currently playing song on Apple Music. Retrieve song data, search for the URL, store it in a variable called "trackURL", clean and copy it to the clipboard](./assets/shortcut.png "THE MAGIC")

> ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Apple Music doesn't always find the current track link because, you know, it's Apple.

## Installation

1. Download the [linked shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f61aa9526e344714b7f0581146e2a8bc) and add it to your shortcuts library.
2. Download [the .alfredworkflow file](./dist/Nowplaying%20for%20Alfred.alfredworkflow) or get it from the **dist/** folder, double click it, and add it to your workflows.
3. Link the appropriate script based on whether you are using Spotify or Apple Music.  ![Steps of the workflow: detect the application and take one path or another to compose the chain to share. Highlight the App script node for review.](./assets/workflow-app.png "Alfred Workflow")
4. Check that the new shortcut is properly linked in the workflow, and that's it. You are good to go!  ![Steps of the workflow: detect the application and take one path or another to compose the chain to share.

## Run it

1. Play some of your stuff on Apple Music or Spotify.
2. Launch Alfred, type `now`, hit enter and as soon as you see the Done! alert, the composed string should be in your clipboard ;)
3. Enjoy!
